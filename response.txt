Based on the video subtitle chunks you provided, I'll answer the user's question:

"Where is html concluded"

The HTML content is concluded in Video 13.

To find out where exactly it starts and ends, we can check the start and end time stamps for Video 13:

Start Time: 520.32 seconds
End Time: 522.16 seconds

According to the video, at this point, "HTML has been concluded."

You can watch this part of the video by navigating to Video #13 and starting it from timestamp 520.32 seconds.

If you want to find out more about CSS (which is related to HTML), we also have an introductory video on CSS in Video #14, starting at timestamp 2.56 seconds.
